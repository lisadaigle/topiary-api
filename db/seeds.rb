When watering, use water that is at room temperature and has been allowed to sit so that the chlorine can evaporate. Spathiphyllum grow very well with sub-irrigation. These plants do well in lower light situations, but prefer bright filtered light. Do not place in direct sun.",

name: "Monstera deliciosa (Swiss Cheese Plant)",
description: "Monstera deliciosa, commonly called split-leaf philodendron or swiss cheese plant, is native to Central America. It is a climbing, evergreen perennial vine that is perhaps most noted for its large perforated leaves on thick plant stems and its long cord-like aerial roots. In its native tropical habitat, it will climb somewhat impressively to 70 ft into large trees, clothing the trunks with leaves in the 1-3ft long range. Indoor plants more typically are grown in the 6-8 ft range. Mature leaves of this plant are very large, glossy, deep green and distinctively cut and perforated.",
